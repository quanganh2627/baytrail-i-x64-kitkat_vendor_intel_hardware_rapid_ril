- This release has been tested with basic sanity tests.

- We are using the HSI interface.

PR2 Setup
=========
KBoot (OS Image): kboot.bin (from ABSP dated October 7,2011 ww41)
IFWI: IFWI_CRAK_PR2v01.10_FSTK_227_IA_51a_SCU_C0.19_VH_1.02_Punit_DA.04_XML_v01.11_830_830_0.854.bin

Modem Firmware: SUNRISE_6260_IMC_MODEM_FIRMWARE_HSI.fls (1138.C)


Release Notes for M5.29
=======================

1. Update RIL Release to use ww41 ABSP files.

2. Change BYTE from 'char' to 'unsigned char'.  This change affected many files.

3. Init commands: send AT+CMEE=1 sooner in sequence.  This allows for '+CME ERROR'
   response in case of error instead of 'ERROR'.

4. Bugzilla 12917: Reserve OEM hook ID for GAN lite integration
   -Integrate patch
   -New Command Id: RIL_OEM_HOOK_RAW_GAN_RIL = 0x01

5. Bugzilla 12715: Ongoing call can't be released immediately after tapping the
                   "hold" key many times.
   -Integrate patch
   -Add function to add CCommand to front of priority queue.

6. IPv6: Feedback from Fabien Hubert.
   -Use AT+XDNS=<cid>,1 and AT+XDNS=<cid>,2 instead of AT+XDNS=<cid>,3 as modem
    does not support it.
   -DataConfigUpIpV6(): Use AF_INET6 where appropriate.

7. Bugzilla 12822: [AUDIO/FDN] The DUT start to dial a forbidden phone number
                   (when FDN activated)
   -Integrate patch with minor modification
   -No need to check for RRIL_RESULT_NOCARRIER, as RIL_UNSOL_RESPONSE_CALL_STATE_CHANGED
    should be sent to Android after any dial command to update call state.  XCALLSTAT
    doesn't appear all the time to trigger this event.

8. Bugzilla 8726: Manage call hang-up reason in RIL_REQUEST_HANGUP_VT
   -Send AT+XSETCAUSE=1,<cause> before ATH

9. Bugzilla 8741: Update error reporting for RIL_REQUEST_SIM_OPEN_CHANNEL,
                  RIL_REQUEST_SIM_TRANSMIT_CHANNEL, RIL_REQUEST_SIM_CLOSE_CHANNEL
   -Create compilation flag M2_SEEK_INVALID_PARAMETER_FEATURE_ENABLED in Android.mk
   -When enabled, RIL sends RIL_E_INVALID_PARAMETER as defined in source code comments
   -NOTE: This adds the RIL_E_INVALID_PARAMETER = 21 in ril.h
          Normally this is = 18 in the original SEEK V2.2.2 implementation.
          To be aligned with Android java framework, align these codes with:
          frameworks/base/telephony/java/com/android/internal/telephony/RILConstants.java

   -(R2 M2_IPV6_FEATURE_ENABLED flag only)

6. Bugzilla 10352: Device shutdown procedure is not correct
   -Integrate patch (R1 and R2)
   -Remove RIL_OEM_HOOK_RAW_POWEROFF.  Read property "sys.shutdown.requested".

     response.  Response in new firmware returns OK instead of +XSIM and +XLOCK responses.
     Modify RIL so that +XSIMSTATE response sends notifications to Android with new sim state.
    -(R1 and R2)

11. Bugzilla 8858: Increase AT command timeouts in repository.txt according to IMC specs.
   -(R1 and R2, New timeouts for R2 will be released in next drop)
   -Commands that use ATH to hangup, IMC rec=35 sec.  RIL now uses 40 seconds.
   -Commands that use AT+COPS? and AT+XCOPS?, IMC rec=90 sec.  RIL now uses 100 seconds.
   -AT+SATD (SIMTk, set up call from SIM), IMC rec=300 sec.  RIL now uses 330 seconds.

   -Commands that have a network dependant timeout, IMC recommends 90 seconds.
   -AT+CCFC (call forwarding).  RIL now uses 90 seconds.
   -AT+CCWA (call waiting).  RIL now uses 90 seconds.
   -AT+CMMS (SMS, more to send).  RIL still uses 180 seconds.
   -AT+CUSD (USSD, cancel USSD).  RIL still uses 180 seconds for send, now uses 90 for cancel.

12. New retry scheme for AT commands. (R1 and R2)
    -If there is AT command timeout, send ABORT command.
    -Timeout of ABORT command dependent on RIL_REQUEST.
        -Abortable commands are: (COPS, CCFC, CLIP, CLIR, COLP, CGACT, CGATT)
        -Other non-abortable commands use 500ms.
    -TODO: If ABORT timeout, close DLC.  Open DLC.
    -Upon response from ABORT or ABORT timeout, send AT+CMEE=1\r to "ping" modem to see if still alive.
    -If modem "ping" passes, RIL assumes modem is alive.
        -If timeout <= "threshold timeout for retry", DO NOT reset modem and resend command.
            -If retry attempt fails and init command, signal clean-up request to STMD.
        -If timeout > "threshold timeout for retry", then DO NOT reset modem and return
         RIL_E_GENERIC_FAILURE to Android.
    -If modem "ping" fails, RIL assumes modem is dead.  Signal clean-up request to STMD.

Release Notes for M5.26
=======================

1. Add RILOemHookRaw test to RIL drop.  The code for this test application is at rapid_ril/TEST.
   -To invoke the test application, at a command prompt, goto into "adb shell" and type:
   am start -n com.android.RILTest/com.android.RILTest.RilOemHookTest

   -NOTE: This test application RILTest.apk is not built by default.  It must be build explicitly
          by doing:
          make -j2 RILTest

          Then install:
          adb install out/target/product/mfld_pr2/system/app/RILTest.apk

          Alternatively, RILTest can be added to PRODUCT_PACKAGES to build by default.

2. Bugzilla 9726: Can not dial extension number correctly
   -Integrate patch

3. Cancel AT commands in progress modification
   -Use command "AT<esc>\r" to cancel AT command in-progress.
   -Change timeout for "ABORTED" reponse to 5.0 seconds from 0.5 seconds.
   -TODO: The entire AT command retry architecture is currently under discussion.
          Will implement new scheme when agreed upon.

4. Bugzilla 1657: map CME error codes to RIL error codes
   -Integrate patch

5. Bugzilla 8741: SEEK for Android: Map XEER error codes to SEEK for Android responses.
   -When SEEK response is CME ERROR, send AT+XEER to get error information.  RIL now
    maps XEER error codes to RIL_E_XXX error values.
   -TODO: RIL_E_INVALID_PARAMETER still needs to be implemented in ril.h, RIL, as well
          as Android java layer.  This will be done for Android v2.3.5.

6. Bugzilla 10335: Remove parameters for OEM hook RIL_OEM_HOOK_RAW_TRIGGER_FAST_DORMANCY
   -Remove parameters, and modify incoming structure.
   -Update OEM Hook test app to support new structure.

September 13, 2011 (M5.25 release for Medfield PR2)

This version of Intrinsyc RapidRIL (RRIL) is intended for the Intel Medfield
PR2 devices, Android version 2.3.4 (Gingerbread).

NOTES:
- This release has been tested with basic sanity tests.
- This release was built with Intel's external ABSP dated August 12, 2011 (ww33)
- We are using the HSI interface.

PR2 Setup
=========
KBoot: kboot.bin (from ABSP dated August 12,2011 ww33)
IFWI: IFWI_CRAK_PR2v01.09a_FSTK_227_IA_48b_SCU_C0.12_VH_0.4F_Punit_C0.0C_XML_v01.0A_830_830_0.854.bin

Release Notes for M5.25
=======================

1. Bugzilla 6991, 9532: Update RRIL to support IPv6 and IPv4v6 (2)
   -Completed second part of IPv6 updates in RIL to support parsing of
    AT+CGPADDR? and AT+XDNS? responses in IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6 formats.
   -TODO: Check and set proper Android system properties in
          DataConfigUp() and DataConfigDown() in te_inf_6260.cpp.

2. TriggerNITZNotification(), no need to copy NITZ string buffer into a temp buffer.

3. Video Telephony: DialVT function
   -Revert AT+XDATACHANNEL command in CTEBase::CoreDialVT()

4. Video Telephony: Add M2_VT_XDATACHANNEL_TEST_ENABLED flag
   -If defined in Android.mk, also with M2_VT_FEATURE_ENABLED flag, RIL will send
    AT+XDATACHANNEL=1,0,"/mux/12","/mux/5",2 during init of ATCmd channel (/dev/gsmtty12)

5. Bugzilla 6688: SIM Lock menu is not displayed using a SIM with pin enabled
   -Integrate patch

6. Bugzilla 5643 update: Messy code display when enter "*188#"
   -Add proper handling of <dcs> value in +CUSD response.
   -Note: RIL currently does not handle other encodings besides default encoding and UCS2.
          May need to support GSM 7-bit and other encodings in the future.

7. R2 feature:  Bugzilla 8745: Extend RIL_REQUEST_GET_SIM_STATUS to return PIN retries
   -Use compilation flag M2_PIN_RETRIES_FEATURE_ENABLED to enable feature.
   -Uses AT+XPINCNT to retreive number of PIN retries for PIN1, PIN2, PUK1, PUK2.
   -The compilation flag is disabled by default in Android.mk.
   -NOTE: The enabler of this feature must make modifications in Android java layer as
          well as libril to marshall the new fields in RIL_AppStatus as defined in ril.h.

8. Remove stmd.h from RIL drop as file is included in hardware/intel/IFX-modem directory.

This version of Intrinsyc RapidRIL (RRIL) is intended for the Intel Medfield
PR2 devices, Android version 2.3.4 (Gingerbread).

NOTES:
- This release has been tested with basic sanity tests.
- This release was built with Intel's external ABSP dated August 12, 2011 (ww33)
- We are using the HSI interface.

PR2 Setup
=========
KBoot: kboot.bin (from ABSP dated August 12,2011 ww33)
IFWI: IFWI_CRAK_PR2v01.09a_FSTK_227_IA_48b_SCU_C0.12_VH_0.4F_Punit_C0.0C_XML_v01.0A_830_830_0.854.bin

Modem Firmware: SUNRISE_SMB_REV30_V2_1130.C_signed_MIPI_HSI_USIF_V2.13.fls


Release Notes for M5.23
=======================

1. Updated build environment to ABSP dated August 12, 2011 (ww33).
   -Updated init.mfld_cdk.rc and init.mfld_pr2.rc in RIL drop.
   -Note iCDK B0 cannot be flashed anymore with this ABSP. Using PR2 only from now on.

2. Add compilation flag for RxDiversity.
   -M2_RXDIV_FEATURE_ENABLED
   -This has been added to M5.22 by Intel.

3. Add separate compilation flags for M2 features.  They are:
   M2_MULTIPLE_PDP_FEATURE_ENABLED  (for multiple primary pdp contexts)
   M2_VT_FEATURE_ENABLED  (for video telephony)
   M2_CALL_FAILED_CAUSE_FEATURE_ENABLED  (for call failed cause notifications)
   M2_RXDIV_FEATURE_ENABLED  (for Rx diversity)
   M2_CELL_BROADCAST_FEATURE_ENABLED  (for cell broadcast)

   -All of these flags are disabled by default.
   -Please see testing matrix below.  Due to time constraints, all combinations
    of M2 flags could not be tested.

4. New reset scheme fixes
   -Change behavior so that RIL will not open /dev/gsmttyX ports until MODEM_UP
    is received from STMD.
   -Modem status watchdog thread only responds to toggle in state (MODEM_UP -> MODEM_DOWN
    or MODEM_DOWN -> MODEM_UP)
   -do_request_clean_up() requests CLEAN_UP from STMD, then exits.
   -MODEM_UP -> MODEM_DOWN = exit RIL.  Init will restart with spoof set until MODEM_UP.
   -MODEM_DOWN -> MODEM_UP = turn off spoof.  Open /dev/gsmttyX ports and continue init.

5. Fix minor memset() bug in te_base.cpp
   -Change sizeof(MAX_BUFFER_SIZE) to MAX_BUFFER_SIZE.
   -This has been added to M5.22 by Intel.

6. Bugzilla 8241: Wrong time displayed on phone
   -Integrate patch.

7. Bugzilla 7937: ongoing call can't be released immediately after inputting
                  numbers during call
   Bugzilla 8277: Unable to receive call while many DTMF are being sent
   -Integrate patches
   -Set high priority to AT commands on RIL_CHANNEL_ATCMD channel that are
    voice call related.

8. Based on Bugzilla 7937, 8277, set "high" priority commands that are
   voice call related.  DTMF will not interfere with voice call commands
   as they now have high priority.  This includes:
   RIL_REQUEST_GET_CURRENT_CALLS (BZ 8277), AT+CLCC
   RIL_REQUEST_DIAL, ATDXXXYYYZZZZ;
   RIL_REQUEST_HANGUP (BZ 5981), AT+CHLD=1X
   RIL_REQUEST_HANGUP_WAITING_OR_BACKGROUND (BZ 5981), AT+CHLD=0
   RIL_REQUEST_HANGUP_FOREGROUND_RESUME_BACKGROUND (BZ 5981), AT+CHLD=1
   RIL_REQUEST_SWITCH_HOLDING_AND_ACTIVE (BZ 5981), AT+CHLD=2
   RIL_REQUEST_CONFERENCE, AT+CHLD=3
   RIL_REQUEST_UDUB, ATH
   RIL_REQUEST_ANSWER, ATA
   RIL_REQUEST_SEPARATE_CONNECTION, AT+CHLD=2X
   RIL_REQUEST_EXPLICIT_CALL_TRANSFER, AT+CHLD=4

9. Bugzilla 8635: Delay observed in powering off the device
   -Integrate patch

10. Bugzilla 8254: No APNs after inserting SIM card to booted PR2
    -Integrate patch

Release Notes for M5.20
=======================

1. M2 feature
   Video Telephony calls support

   -Added 2 new RIL_REQUEST APIs in ril.h:
   #define RIL_REQUEST_HANGUP_VT 108
   #define RIL_REQUEST_DIAL_VT 109

   -Added 1 new RIL_UNSOL define in ril.h:
   #define RIL_UNSOL_CALL_FAILED_CAUSE 1031

   -NOTE: RIL source code for this is wrapped in #if defined(M2_FEATURE_ENABLED)
          This is enabled by default.

   -AT commands for HangupVT and DialVT are in rapid_ril/CORE/ND/te_base.cpp
    Functions: CTEBase::CoreHangupVT() and CTEBase::CoreDialVT()
   -Notification handling for CallFailedCause is in rapid_ril/CORE/ND/silo_voice.cpp
    Functions: CSilo_Voice::ParseCallFailedCause() and string to look for will have
               to be modified in static ATRSPTABLE pATRspTable[].

   -NOTE: This code is currently untested due to lack of Android middleware support.

   -NOTE: The AT command for VT hangup is currently set at "ATH".  A future patch is
          pending to update this.

   -NOTE: For incoming VT calls, a "+CRING: SYNC" is expected from the modem.  The
          handling of +CRING notifications is done in rapid_ril/CORE/ND/silo_voice.cpp
          function CSilo_Voice::ParseExtRing().  Currently, RIL_UNSOL_CALL_RING is
          sent to Android, but a special VT ring notification can be sent here.

2. M2 feature
   Multiple PDP context support
   -Added support for 5 DLC data channels in RIL.
   -Added support for dynamic context IDs in RIL code (used for establishing data
    connection, setting Android system properties, and deactivating data).
   -Multiple PDP uses same RIL APIs (RIL_REQUEST_SETUP_DATA_CALL and
    RIL_REQUEST_DEACTIVATE_DATA_CALL) to establish and deactivate data connections.
   -Port names are defined in init.mfld_xxx.rc file using the -d flag in the
    ril-daemon argument list.  All 5 DLC data channels must be defined in the
    init.mfld_xxx.rc file if this feature (M2_FEATURE_ENABLED) is enabled in the build.

   -NOTE: RIL source code for this is wrapped in #if defined(M2_FEATURE_ENABLED)
          This is enabled by default.

   -NOTE: This code is mainly untested due to lack of Android middleware support.
          However, setting the constant PDP_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE to more than 1
          has had limited success in called RIL_REQUEST_SETUP_DATA_CALL more than
          once.  The constant is in GsmDataConnectionTracker.java in
          frameworks/base/telephony/java/com/android/internal/telephony/gsm
          More investigation with this is required.

   -NOTE: Certain system properties will have to be changed to support multiple PDP.
          These can be found in rapid_ril/CORE/ND/MODEMS/te_inf_6260.cpp function
          DataConfigUp() and DataConfigDown().
          net.gprs.local-ip
          net.gprs.operstate
          gsm.net.interface


3. Update init.mfld_cdk.rc to ww30 bits (same as ABSP).
   Add init.mfld_pr2.rc to RIL drop.
   Add repository.txt in mfld_PR2 directory to RIL drop.

4. Fix function DataConfigDown() to return FALSE immediately if invalid Context ID is
   passed in.

5. In case of "+CGEV: NW DEACT" notification, need to pass CID from the notification to
   the triggerDeactivateDataCall() function.  Previously this was hard-coded to 1.
   RIL supports multiple PDP so this needed to be changed.

6. Add comments to repository.txt to describe how some settings function.

7. Fix patch for cell broadcast (Bugzilla 5751).

8. Bugzilla 6687 - Adding SMS CB (Pdu decoding)
   -Incorporate patch.

9. Bugzilla 6202 - UI displays no services with a permanently blocked SIM card
   -Treat "SIM Wrong" (+CME ERROR: 15) response properly.

10. Bugzilla 5079 - Rx Diversity
    -Remove AT+XRXDIV=1,3 string from init commands, until it is OK to put it back in.

11. Bugzilla 2822 - 3GPP conformance - SATK Icon test are failing
    -Fix restricted SIM command function.  Replace "img" with "graphics" full path which
     is "3F007F105F50".


Known Issues:
=============
-RIL_REQUEST_DATA_CALL_LIST API returns 0 active contexts when more than one context is
 active.  Fix is in progress, target is next drop.

-RIL_REQUEST_GET_NEIGHBORING_CELL_IDS API is broken and will return RIL_E_GENERIC_ERROR
 when called.  Fix is in progress, target is next drop.

7. In WatchdogThreadProc(), if poll() returns an error, sleep() then call
   poll() again.  The sleep() is set to 250ms.


Known ABSP/modem Issues:
=========================
- During a voice call, a clicking noise is heard every half a second.  This only
  seems to happen with the device.

   NOTE: Sometimes RIL receives '+XSIM: 0' from modem in middle of switching
         technologies.  This causes RIL to re-init because it assumes someone
         inserted a new SIM card (part of hot swappable SIM feature).  The
         '+XSIM: 0' notification should not be sent because the SIM was never
         removed from the device.  A side effect of this is that the modem
         sometimes does not register with a network again.
   NOTE: A hardware modification will fix this bug (not implmented for test)

   -Trigger Fast Dormancy AT+XFDOR=<mode>[,<FDDelay-Timer>][,<SCRI-Timer>]
   -Set Fast Dormancy Timer AT+XFDORT=<timer_value>

   -Trigger Fast Dormancy shall have:
   unsigned char cCommandId; // shall be 0xBB
   int nMode; // 1,2,3
   int nFDDDelayTimer;  // int from 0-60
   int nSCRITimer;  // int from 1 to 120

   -Set Fast Dormancy Timer shall have:
   unsigned char cCommandId; // shall be 0xCC
   int nTimerValue; // int from 0-120

2. Emergency numbers: Set AT+XLEMA=1 to get emergency call codes on the URC channel.
   RIL will set system property "ril.ecclist" with the list of ECC codes,
   separated by a comma (e.g. "911,112,08").  This is set when the +XLEMA URC has
   completed notifying RIL of the ECC List update.

3. Add modified patch from Frederic Berat to change interface name to
   rmnet0 from gsm03.

4. Add patch from Frederic Predon for "emergency call only" mode.  This adds 10
   to the AT+CREG? response if certain criteria are met.

5. Add patch for network depersonalization (set radio status to ready).  Patch
   was received from Frederic Predon.

6. Incorporate Bi Chao patch, call AT+CPWD="P2",<pin2>,<pin2> when CPIN2? is READY
   for FDN access (RIL_REQUEST_SIM_IO).

7. In repository.txt, set DisableCoreDump to 0.  Modified a comment.

8. DTMF tones: Remove previous change, and return RIL_E_SUCCESS to
   RIL_REQUEST_DTMF_STOP.

9. Remove unused code.


Known ABSP/modem Issues:
=========================
- During a voice call, a clicking noise is heard every half a second.  This only
  seems to happen with the device.
- Conference call, DTMF tones.  Ensure DTMF tones working.
    FAIL.  AT command returns OK but no DTMF tone.
    NOTE: Infineon says this is by design.
- General Dialer UI sluggishness during conference call.


Testing results:  (tested with HSI interface)
================

1. Boot to steady-state (network registered, signal strength), No SIM PIN lock.
   PASS

2. Connect data, download data.
   PASS

3. Disconnect data (uncheck "Data enabled" checkbox).

6. Switch technology from 3G -> 2G only.  Download data.
   PASS (conditional)
   NOTE: Sometimes RIL receives '+XSIM: 0' from modem in middle of switching
         technologies.  This causes RIL to re-init because it assumes someone
         inserted a new SIM card (part of hot swappable SIM feature).  The
         '+XSIM: 0' notification should not be sent because the SIM was never
         removed from the device.  A side effect of this is that the modem
         sometimes does not register with a network again.
   NOTE: A hardware modification will fix this bug (not implmented for test)

May 26, 2011 (M5.10 release for Medfield CDK)

This version of Intrinsyc RapidRIL (RRIL) is intended for the Intel Medfield CDK device,
Android version 2.3 (Gingerbread).

NOTES:
- This release has been tested with basic sanity tests.
- This release was tested with Intel's external ABSP dated May 4, 2011.
- We are using the HSI interface.

KBoot: kboot.mfld_cdk.2011.0504.2055.bin
IFWI: IFWI_vB0.16b-Android_HSI.bin
Misc Module: Signed_PNW_B0_FWR_DnX_FD.15.bin
OS Recovery Module: Signed_PNW_B0_OSR_DnX_0D.35.bin
Modem Firmware: SUNRISE_SMB_REV30_V1.1_1116.C_signed_MIPI_HSI.fls
Modem: Rev2


Release Notes for M5.10
=======================

1. Implement start/stop DTMF.
   Start tone:  AT+VTS=<tone>
   Stop tone:   AT+VTS=
   Note: This will be changed to AT+XVTS when modem implements AT+XVTS.

2. Remove poll loop in RIL_Init().  Modify RIL_Init() so that mainLoop() is called
   directly instead of spawning a thread.  The function mainLoop() will return when
   RIL initialization is complete.  This eliminates the need for a poll loop on a
   global variable. (Bug 696)

3. Modify RIL port open attempt interval to 1000ms from 2000ms.  This default value
   has been updated in code and in repository.txt (name = "OpenPortInterval").

4. SIM Toolkit: Add support for SIM_REFRESH cases.  RIL will send RIL_UNSOL_SIM_REFRESH
   as well as RIL_UNSOL_STK_EVENT_NOTIFY.  The SIM_REFRESH command is found by searching
   the +SATN string for "8103".  Then if a FileId is required, the string "92" is searched
   for later on in the string.  The length of the FileId tag is read and the last 2 bytes
   are the FileId (e.g. 6F3A).

5. Incorporate patch 1346 from Frederic Predon. Rename gsm03 to rmnet0 in repository.txt.
   This patch also sets the default gateway once the PDP context is up.

6. Minor changes with some of the log comments (comment wasn't matching function name).

7. Incorporate patch 2481 from Frederic Berat.  Don't set net.interfaces.defaultroute
   as it does not exist.  Allow RIL permission to modify net.gsm03.dns1/2.

Release Notes for M5.9
======================

1. In repository.txt, set "DisableCoreDump" to "1" by default.

2. Fix bug 1487 - 3GPP conformance: 34123-1 16.1.10 simultaneous send/receive SMS
   Move AT command channel to use /dev/gsmtty12 instead of /dev/gsmtty1.  Put all URCs on
   /dev/gsmtty1 channel.  This will solve the issue of receiving a notification in the middle
   of receiving a solicited response and the OK.
   Note that I had to move the SMS ACK from SMS channel to another channel
   (I chose the AT command channel). If SMS ack is kept on the SMS channel, then when sending
   large SMS to yourself, the channel will get blocked by the outgoing SMS packets.  Meanwhile
   incoming SMS packets are not being ACKd.

3. Fix bug 2222 - handle +XSIM: 9 for the SIM removed event for modem FW 1119B
   SIM removal: +XSIM: 9 is now received when removing SIM card. RIL now handles this case, as
   well as SIM insertion.

4. Minor change: Remove code from oem hook raw parse function that is not being used.

5. Fix bug 1541 - No data after hot-swapping the SIM card
   There was an ioctl that was not being called by RIL when disconnecting data in some
   situations.  This has now been fixed.

6. Fix bug 1934 - 3GPP conformance 31.8.7 FAIL - Call barring UI indication not accurate
   Added cause CEER code of 8 to CALL_FAIL_CALL_BARRED case.

7. Incorporate patch from Fred that fixes IMEISV.
   Handle case where output of CGMR is "V1.1,nn" where nn are the two digits of SV.

8. SIM Toolkit: SIM_REFRESH unsolicited notification.
   I put in a temporary "hack" solution to look for the SIM_REFRESH command ID in the
   +SATN: notification.  Need to implement a TLV parser to extract the proper SIM_REFRSH
   command ID as well as the FildId(s) that need updating.
   For this release, when RIL receives SIM_REFRESH, call SIM_REFRESH unsol with SIM_INIT
   flag regardless of what kind of refresh the notification actually is.
   Please see CSilo_SIM::ParseIndicationSATN() in CORE/ND/silo_sim.cpp.


Known ABSP/modem Issues:
=========================
- During a voice call, a clicking noise is heard every half a second.  This only
  seems to happen with the device.
- The ifxreset application does not function with this ABSP.  This is because
  the reset IOCTL was not implemented in this ABSP release.


Testing results:  (tested with HSI interface)

Release Notes for M5.8
======================

1. Incorporate patch from Sri: "0001-RapidRIL-Data-Call-recovery-when-system-server-crash.patch"
   The patch calls the AT command "AT+CGACT=0,1" to deactivate the PDP context when
   "+CGEV: NW DEACT" is received.

2. Add "DisableWatchdogThread" flag to repository.txt.  By default, this is set to "0".  If this
   flag is set to "1", the watchdog thread is never started.  Therefore unsolicited modem
   resets will not be caught.  Also the core dump utility will not function.

3. Minor edit for CoreSetFacilityLock().  (info from Jack)

4. Fix repository.txt read when repository.txt file has Windows line endings.

5. Modify AT+CPWROFF to AT+CFUN=0 for the RIL_REQUEST_OEM_HOOK_RAW function.

6. Added "OpenPortRetries" and "OpenPortInterval" to repository.txt in the "Group RILSettings"
   section.
   -"OpenPortRetries" is the number of attempts RIL makes to open gsmttyX ports before radio
    reset is called.
    Default is 30 if this setting is omitted.
   -"OpenPortInterval" is the delay in ms between each open port attempt.
    Default is 2000 if this setting is omitted.

7. Modify exponential timer and opening of gsmttyX ports.  If RIL cannot open ports after
   a defined number of attempts, then call TriggerRadioError() to attempt to reset the modem.

8. Added descriptions in repository.txt for "DisableModemReset" and "DisableWatchdogThread":

   DisableModemReset
   -If set to "0", then modem reset is actually executed (close ports, stop stmd, call ifxreset
    (ifxreset is not performed if the reset is initiated by the WatchdogThread), start stmd,
    open ports, restart RIL)
   -If set to "1", then just set global variable so future requests from Android are errored out
    with RIL_E_RADIO_NOT_AVAILABLE
   -If missing, then assume value is set to "0", and modem reset will be executed.

   DisableWatchdogThread
   -If set to "0", then watchdog thread is created and poll() is called on /dev/gsmtty1 port.
    If POLLHUP is returned from poll() call, then modem reset is called (see DisableModemReset
    above)
   -If set to "1", then watchdog thread is never created.  If there is an uncolicited modem
    reset (e.g. one initiated by the modem as described above), then it will not be received.
    Modem core dump processing by the RIL will also not work since that requires the watchdog
    thread.
   -If missing, then assume value is set to "0", and watchdog thread is created.

9. Added "RadioResetDelay" and "RadioResetStartStmdDelay" to repository.txt in the
   "Group Modem" section.
   -"RadioResetDelay" is the time to sleep in ms after calling reset ioctl to reset the modem
    If missing, default value is 2000 ms.
    Note: This is not called if "DisableModemReset" is set to "1".
   -"RadioResetStartStmdDelay" is the time to sleep in ms after starting stmd during the reset
    sequence.  If missing, default value is 4000 ms.

10. Fix possible NULL pointer dereference in channelbase.cpp function CommandThread().
    Thanks Jack for the find.

11. Modify header file location in Android.mk file.  Also updated #include for HSI headers.

- During a voice call, a clicking noise is heard every half a second.  This only
  seems to happen with the device.
- The ifxreset application does not function with this ABSP.  This is because
  the reset IOCTL was not implemented in this ABSP release.


Testing results:  (tested with HSI interface)
================

1. Boot to steady-state (network registered, signal strength), No SIM PIN lock.
   PASS

2. Connect data, download data.
   PASS

3. Disconnect data (uncheck "Data enabled" checkbox).
   Reconnect data (check "Data enabled" checkbox).
   Download data.

5. Exit Flight Mode.  Data should re-connect.  Download data.
   PASS

6. Switch technology from 3G -> 2G only.  Download data.
   PASS (conditional)
   NOTE: Sometimes RIL receives '+XSIM: 0' from modem in middle of switching
         technologies.  This causes RIL to re-init because it assumes someone
         inserted a new SIM card (part of hot swappable SIM feature).  The
         '+XSIM: 0' notification should not be sent because the SIM was never
         removed from the device.  A side effect of this is that the modem
         sometimes does not register with a network again.
   NOTE: A hardware modification will fix this bug (not implmented for test)

Apr. 21, 2011 (M5.5 release for Medfield CDK)

This version of Intrinsyc RapidRIL (RRIL) is intended for the Intel Medfield CDK device,
Android version 2.3 (Gingerbread).

NOTES:
- This release has been tested with basic sanity tests.
- This release was tested with Intel's Gingerbread ABSP from the Intel lab

KBoot: kboot.mfld_cdk.2011.0214.2212.bin
Firmware: V176.009/B0.09
Modem Firmware: *OCEAN_6260_SMB_REV30_1105.01_B3*
Modem: Rev2


Release Notes for M5.5
======================
What's new:

1. Bug 703: Cannot enter airplane mode when no SIM inserted.
   Fixed.  RIL was sending an incorrect radio state notification for that particular
   situation.  RIL now sends RADIO_OFF for airplane mode in that state.

2. Core dump: This release includes the "Core Dump" feature.  To activate the "Core
   Dump", the "coredump_svc" must be defined and point to the core dump executable in
   the init.mfld_cdk.rc file.  This feature also needs the IOCTL definitions from the
   hsi_ffl_tty.h header file located at hardware/intel/linux-2.6/include/linux/hsi
   directory.  Namely, the FFL_TTY_GET_HANGUP_REASON IOCTL is used to query the
   POLLHUP reason.

   To disable core dump functionality, set the "DisableCoreDump" value to "1" in the
   repository.txt file under the group "Group Modem".

3. Hot SIM swap: Removing SIM will make Android display "No SIM inserted, emergency
   calls only" message.  User will also see SIM icon at top in status area.  Re-
   inserting SIM will make Android query info for the new SIM card.  Hot swappable
   SIM also works in flight mode.

4. Call barring fix: Fix AT command when no class is specified.

5. Code cleanup: Remove unnecessary functions.  Change inf_n721 to inf_6260.
   In repository.txt, replace "InfineonN721" with "Infineon6260".

6. Update ifxreset.c with HSI IOCTLs.


Testing results:  (tested with SPI interface)
================

1. Boot to steady-state (network registered, signal strength), No SIM PIN lock.
   PASS--not consistent for every boot due to SPI/MUX initialization problem.

2. Connect data, download data.
   PASS

3. Disconnect data (uncheck "Data enabled" checkbox).

Release Notes for M5.4
======================
What's new:

1. Implement 'Hot Swappable SIM card'.  RIL uses the +XSIM notification to
   determine if the SIM card has been removed.  RIL also uses the +XSIM
   notification to determine if a SIM card has been inserted.  Upon insertion
   RIL is re-initialized.

2. Fix parsing for TTY responses ("CTM/TTY mode:" changed to "+XCTMS: ").

3. Fix response for IMEI, IMEISV, Baseband Version so it displays correct values.
   Also limit response to 82 characters maximum (Android only supports 82 chars
   for these otherwise phone process will crash)
   IMEI:  AT+CGSN
   IMSISV: AT+CGSN;+CGMR  (append digits of CGMR response to IMEI string)
   Baseband Version: AT+XGENDATA  (first line of response)

4. Apply 2 Sim Toolkit patches
   -Use XSATK instead of CFUN=6 to start SIMTK.
   -Check status code for STK session end.

5. NITZ: No need to parse +CTZDST notification in +CTZV handler as the framework
   will handle that automatically.  Note we do not need to use CTZDST value as
   notification from modem includes DST offset.

6. When RIL attempts to open /dev/gsmttyX port and it fails, display the errno
   code in the radio logcat as well as the error string.
   (e.g. errno=51, Level 2 halted)

7. Updated property_service.c with Jack's latest changes.
   (added ifxreset to whitelist)
   Also updated init.mfld_cdk.rc and core.mk.
   This will make integration easier.

8. Changed filetype permissions on RapidRIL files so all source files have
   non-executable permissions (Jack's suggestion).


Known ABSP/modem Issues:
=========================
- Does not camp on a network on every boot.  May require several power cycles.  This
  is because RIL cannot open the /dev/gsmttyX ports.  The open() call fails with
  errorno = 51 (Level 2 halted).

- While browsing, sometimes, a web page does not finish loading.  After a few minutes,
  voice/data disconnects.

- No audio from the speaker/mic during a call and when there's an incoming call (ring).
  No audio as well from a headset plugged into the speaker jack (DTMF tones and the
  incoming ringer only).

- RIL cannot connect to /dev/gsmttyX ports even though STMD has started and the ports
  exist.  The errorno is 51 (level 2 halted).  A possible fix which works some of the
  time is in adb shell:
  # stop stmd &
  # ifxreset &
  # start stmd &



Testing results:
================

1. Boot to steady-state (network registered, signal strength), No SIM PIN lock.
   PASS--not consistent for every boot due to SPI/MUX initialization problem.

2. Connect data, download data.
   PASS

3. Disconnect data (uncheck "Data enabled" checkbox).
   Reconnect data (check "Data enabled" checkbox).

5. Exit Flight Mode.  Data should re-connect.  Download data.
   PASS

6. Switch technology from 3G -> 2G only.  Download data.
   PASS (conditional)
   NOTE: Sometimes RIL receives '+XSIM: 0' from modem in middle of switching
         technologies.  This causes RIL to re-init because it assumes someone
         inserted a new SIM card (part of hot swappable SIM feature).  The
         '+XSIM: 0' notification should not be sent because the SIM was never
         removed from the device.  A side effect of this is that the modem
         sometimes does not register with a network again.

Mar. 31, 2011 (M5.3 release for Medfield CDK)

This version of Intrinsyc RapidRIL (RRIL) is intended for the Intel Medfield CDK device,
Android version 2.3 (Gingerbread).

NOTES:
- This release has been tested with basic sanity tests.
- This release was tested with Intel's Gingerbread ABSP from the Intel lab

KBoot: kboot.mfld_cdk.2011.0214.2212.bin
Firmware: V176.009/B0.09
Modem Firmware: *OCEAN_6260_SMB_REV30_1106.01_B3*
Modem: Rev2


Release Notes for M5.3
======================
What's new:

1. Added fix to support COLR and COLP USSD notifications.  Normally, unrecognized MMI
   commands would generate +CUSD responses from the modem (from AT+CUSD command),
   however, when querying COLR and COLP (*#77# and *#76# from the dialer), +COLR and
   +COLP responses are returned.  These responses weren't handled previously.

2. Removed unecessary code in the TriggerRadioError() function for reverting back to
   standard line discipline before stopping STMD.  The line discipline is already
   removed when STMD is stopped.

3. Removed XRAT=1,2 from the init string for DCL2.  The modem default is XRAT=1,2 so
   setting this on init isn't necessary.

4. Added fix for correctly displaying the time when +CTZDST is not part of the NITZ response.
   Note: This has NOT been tested.

5. Removed the sending of AT+XDRV from CoreDial() and CoreAnswer() in te_base.cpp.
   This was existing code from the initial Medfield ABSP and isn't necessary anymore.

6. Removed offending whitespace from all RIL code--trailing spaces, tabs.


Known ABSP/modem Issues:
=========================
- Does not camp on a network on every boot.  May require several power cycles.  This
  is because RIL cannot open the /dev/gsmttyX ports.  The open() call fails with
  errorno = 51 (Level 2 halted).

- While browsing, sometimes, a web page does not finish loading.  After a few minutes,
  voice/data disconnects.

- No audio from the speaker/mic during a call and when there's an incoming call (ring).
  No audio as well from a headset plugged into the speaker jack (DTMF tones and the
  incoming ringer only).

- RIL cannot connect to /dev/gsmttyX ports even though STMD has started and the ports
  exist.  The errorno is 51 (level 2 halted).  A possible fix which works some of the
  time is in adb shell:

Mar. 25, 2011 (M5.2 release for Medfield CDK)

This version of Intrinsyc RapidRIL (RRIL) is intended for the Intel Medfield CDK device,
Android version 2.3 (Gingerbread).

NOTES:
- This release has been tested with basic sanity tests.
- This release was tested with Intel's Gingerbread ABSP from the Intel lab

KBoot: kboot.mfld_cdk.2011.0214.2212.bin
Firmware: V176.009/B0.09
Modem Firmware: *OCEAN_6260_SMB_REV30_1105.01_B3*
Modem: Rev2


Release Notes for M5.2
======================
What's new:

1. Bug 519 - Activate call waiting bug using MMI codes
   Fixed.  Now can use *43# to activate call waiting.

2. Add "DisableModemReset" in repository.txt under group "Modem".
   "0" = Use IFX_MODEM_RESET IOCTL to reset modem when calling TriggerRadioError().
         RIL attempts to connect to modem ports and re-init gracefully.
   "1" = Do not use IFX_MODEM_RESET IOCTL.  Set global flag that errors out all
         future requests from Android.

3. Add support for re-initializing RIL and STMD when modem has reset itself.  RRIL
   implements a watchdog thread that uses poll() on '/dev/gsmtty1' to wait for the
   POLLHUP event.  If received, then modem has reset itself.  RRIL re-initializes
   the STMD and RIL, and attempts re-init (depending on 'DisableModemReset' flag).

4. Bug 428 - Power consumption
   Fixed.  Added AT+XPOW=0,0,0 to AT init strings.

5. For "Use only 2G networks" UI option, simply use AT+XRAT command without
   unregistering and re-registering to network.

6. NITZ notifications were not working properly.  This is now fixed.

7. There was a parsing error regarding +CREG and +CGREG commands for the unsolicited
   and solicited cases.  This was causing some errors in the UI.  This is now fixed.

8. When screen is off, RIL was turning network updates off to conserve power.  This
   may cause the UI to display a wrong network state when screen is back on again.
   RIL now keeps network updates enabled.

9. Fix USSD notifications.  There was a <cr> missing from the end of the +CUSD
   response from the modem.  This was causing parsing issues and causing USSD not to
   work.  This is now fixed (as long as response is +CUSD to the AT+CUSD request).


Known ABSP/modem Issues:
=========================
- Does not camp on a network on every boot.  May require several power cycles.  This
  is because RIL cannot open the /dev/gsmttyX ports.  The open() call fails with
  errorno = 51 (Level 2 halted).

- While browsing, sometimes, a web page does not finish loading.  After a few minutes,
  voice/data disconnects.

- No audio from the speaker/mic during a call and when there's an incoming call (ring).
  No audio as well from a headset plugged into the speaker jack.

  exist.  The errorno is 51 (level 2 halted).  A possible fix which works some of the
  time is in adb shell:
  # stop stmd &
  # ifxreset &
  # start stmd &

- If entering *#77# in the dialer, the AT+CUSD command reponse is +COLR: X.  RIL currently
  does not handle non +CUSD responses to AT+CUSD command.  This will be fixed in a
  future release.

2. Fixed call forwarding issue with MMI commands.
   MMI command #21# was not sending AT command to modem due to NULL number check.

3. Added code to call radio reset when attempting to open ports after 5 failed retries.
   This code is in the RIL but commented out (Sri request).  Will investigate for
   future drop.

This version of Intrinsyc RapidRIL (RRIL) is intended for the Intel Medfield CDK device,
Android version 2.3 (Gingerbread).

NOTES:
- This release has been tested with basic sanity tests.
- This release was tested with Intel's Gingerbread ABSP and is based on the
  M3.5 release for the PR1 device (Moorestown).

KBoot: kboot.mfld_cdk.2011.0214.2212.bin
Firmware: V176.009/B0.09
Modem Firmware: *OCEAN_6260_SMB_REV30_1105.01_B3*
Modem: Rev2


Release Notes for M5.0
======================
What's new:

1. Added modem reset code. This code in TriggerRadioError() (in rildmain.cpp) calls the ioctl
   to reset the modem and perform re-initialization.

2. Added the UseUSIMAddress flag to repository.txt to use a different address when retrieving
   phonebook entries from a USIM card (CRSM restricted SIM command). If set to 0, the reading
   of phone contacts from the SIM card is done using a normal SIM address. If set to 1, the
   USIM address is used. This is used for diagnosing Bug 416 (issue when reading SIM contacts using
   the USIM contact address) and allows switching between USIM and normal SIM addresses without
   re-compiling the RIL.


Known ABSP/modem Issues:
=========================
- Does not camp on a network on every boot.  May require several power cycles.

=========================
- Takes > 3 mins to camp to the mobile network. Does not camp reliably to the network.

- No audio from the speaker/mic during a call, however the ringer can be heard from the speaker.
  No audio as well from a headset plugged into the speaker jack.

- Cannot create an APN. After entering the APN settings, the following error occurs after
  trying to save it:

          can repro this with Gingerbread emulator.  This may require a fix in the Messaging App.

    FAIL--cannot create APN.
